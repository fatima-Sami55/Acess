*   🖼️ Product image uploads via Multer
*   🛠️ Admin control panel for managing products
*   🕐 Cron jobs for background tasks like notifications

💻 Tech Stack
-------------

##### 🧠 Backend

*   **Node.js & Express** — Core server logic and routing
*   **MSSQL (via `mssql`)** — Main database, hosted on Azure
*   **connect-mssql-v2** — Session store using SQL Server
*   **Passport.js** — Local strategy for user authentication
*   **Socket.IO** — Real-time communication for notifications
*   **Node-cron** — Task scheduling for background jobs

##### 🎨 Frontend

*   **EJS** — Templating engine for server-rendered HTML
*   **Bootstrap 5** — Responsive layout and UI components
*   **TailwindCSS** — Utility-first styling for custom design
*   **JavaScript** — Form validation, AJAX, and dynamic UI behavior

🌐 Responsiveness
-----------------

The entire application is built with a mobile-first approach using Bootstrap grid system and Tailwind utility classes. The layout adapts seamlessly across:

*   💻 Desktop (sidebars, dropdowns, modals)
*   🖥️ Large screens (multi-column product galleries)
